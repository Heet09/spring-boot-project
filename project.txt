Overview You are designing a system to deploy a Spring Boot application on AWS using EC2, behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB), connected to a PostgreSQL database (RDS). 
The deployment and provisioning are automated using Terraform and GitHub Actions (CI/CD). Components User → ALB (Application Load Balancer) Users access your application via the ALB. 
The ALB distributes incoming HTTP requests to multiple EC2 instances running the Spring Boot application. App Servers (EC2 Instances) Two EC2 instances host the Spring Boot application. 
They are in the private subnet (for security, so they’re not publicly exposed directly). Spring Boot is configured to connect to PostgreSQL for database operations. 
Database (PostgreSQL / RDS) Managed PostgreSQL database hosted in AWS RDS. The Spring Boot app communicates with this database over the internal network. 
Likely in a private subnet as well, not accessible from the internet directly. Infrastructure Automation Terraform Provisions the environment: VPC: Virtual network for your application. 
Subnets: Public subnet (for ALB) and private subnet (for EC2 & RDS). Other resources like security groups, IAM roles, etc. 
Terraform scripts are triggered via GitHub Actions. CI/CD (GitHub Actions) Automates Spring Boot deployment: Clone the repository from GitHub. 
Build the project using Maven or Gradle. Generate the artifact (like a .jar file). Deploy the artifact to EC2 instances. Can also include tests, notifications, or rollback strategies. 
Workflow User Request → hits ALB ALB → forwards request to one of the EC2 app servers Spring Boot App → queries PostgreSQL (RDS) EC2 logs, metrics, or auto-scaling can be configured based on load. 
Key Notes Public subnet is typically used for the ALB so it can be accessed from the internet. Private subnet hosts your EC2 instances and RDS for better security. 
Terraform + GitHub Actions ensures Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and automated deployment. This setup is scalable: you can add more EC2 instances behind the ALB easily. draw a clean diagram for this architecture
